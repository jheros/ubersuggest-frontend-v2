  "absent_doctype": "don't have doctype declared",
  "absent_doctype_how": "Make sure to add a doctype for all of your pages. You will need to add the <!Doctype> element in the source code before the <html> tag at the top of the page. This might get tricky for someone who has little or no experience with HTML so asking someone with experience to help adding your doctype can be helpful. ",
  "absent_doctype_what": "A doctype tells your browser about the HTML or XHTML that is being used on your site. In order for your page to load quickly and without error, having your doctype setup is a must. If you do not declare your doctype, it is likely that your site will suffer when it comes to SEO. If your HTML doesn’t load properly, the content on your page might not display correctly, which will be negative for the user experience. It can also cause your page to load slower than usual, something Google frowns upon as users expect a fast and seamless experience from content that is ranking high in search results.",
  "absent_encoding_meta_tag": "don't have character encoding declared",
  "absent_encoding_meta_tag_how": "One way you can resolve this problem is by using the meta charset attribute (<meta charset=\"utf-8\"/>) in your HTML. Another way to fix this is to declare the character encoding in the charset parameter: (Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8). This can be found in the HTTP Content-Type header. \n\nTo learn more about this process, check out these two great resources: \n<b>Character Encoding - HTTP header</b>  \n<b>Character Encoding - HTML</b>",
  "absent_encoding_meta_tag_what": "Character encoding lets the internet browser know the different kinds of characters that need to be displayed for the content on a page. By not declaring character encoding, you run the risk of having pages on your site that don’t load properly. If your pages don’t load properly or the page renders with errors, your user will not have a positive experience on your site and will bounce away quickly, potentially not coming back. Your on-page metrics can go down because of this and, over time, you will start to fall in the rankings as your metrics will tell Google that your site doesn’t provide a great experience.",
